Melodica is a React-based music app that fetches data from the Spotify API to display artists, popular songs, and allows users to search for tracks. It incorporates React Router for navigation, Context API for global state management, and additional features like adding songs to playlists, creating playlists, deleting playlists, liking songs, and more.

Shimmer Effect: Provides a loading animation (shimmer effect) for smooth user experience while data is being fetched.
Context API for Global State Management: Handles the global state of the app, including liked songs, playlists, and the management of adding/removing tracks to/from playlists.
Create and Delete Playlists: Users can create new playlists and delete existing ones.

How It Works
1. Navigation:
The app uses React Router to handle navigation between pages. You can navigate between the Home page, Playlist management page, and other pages through the navigation bar.

2. Spotify API Integration:
The app fetches data from the Spotify API to display:

Artists: Top artists in a specific genre or search query.
Popular Songs: Popular tracks to listen to.
Track Search: Allows users to search for songs by name, artist, or album.
3. Global State Management with Context API:
The app uses Context API for managing global state. Key state variables include:

Liked Tracks: A list of tracks that the user has liked.
Playlists: A list of user-created playlists, where tracks can be added or removed.
The Context API makes it easy to manage and update this state globally without prop drilling.

4. Playlist Features:
Creating Playlists: Users can create custom playlists.
Adding Tracks to Playlists: Users can add tracks from the search or popular song list to any of their playlists.
Deleting Playlists: Users can delete any of their created playlists.
5. Liking Songs:
Users can like or unlike songs, with liked songs being displayed in a dedicated section.
The app provides a "Like" button that toggles between a heart icon and an unfilled heart icon.
6. Shimmer Effect:
While waiting for data from Spotify, a shimmer effect (custom loading animation) is displayed to improve user experience.
